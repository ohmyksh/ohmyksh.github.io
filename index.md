<p> Hello! I am a senior student at Pohang University of Science and Technology, expected to graduate in Aug 2025.</p>

<p>My research focuses on Natural Language Processing, aiming to enable large language models to perform human-like reasoning by leveraging external knowledge and feedback to solve complex problems, particularly through retrieval-augmented LMs. </p>
<p> I really enjoy exchanging ideas and getting inspired by others. Feel free to reach out through any channel if you’re interested in my work or just want to connect!</p>
