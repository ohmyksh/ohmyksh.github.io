I’ve come to realize that I both enjoy and need to study philosophy. I’ve read the works of Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hermann Hesse, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Philosophy leads one to live with an awareness of one’s own meaning and value. It teaches not what to think, but how to think. It allows me to live as the subject of my own life. Ultimately, the very act of asking questions is philosophy itself — which is why I enjoy reading it.

I’ve added a new destination to my journey: **I want to possess the wisdom to think and judge for myself.** As an engineer, simply solving assigned problems or publishing papers doesn’t feel like enough. Even if my profession is engineering, I don’t just want to be a scholar — I want to be an **intellectual**.

* If I can answer the question “why?” that I pose to myself with clarity, then everything that follows becomes simple. Once the path ahead becomes clear, all that remains is to walk it. (Nietzsche)
* Everyone wants to live happily, yet few truly know what makes life happy. We must first understand exactly what it is we seek. The road to happiness is often deceptive; the most crowded and well-known paths are frequently the false ones. (Seneca)
* Philosophy is the question of why human beings live, and what they must do to realize that reason. (Schopenhauer)
* The world is not made up of given things, but of the totality of facts as we perceive them. A world that one cannot describe in one’s own language holds no meaning. What helps us cultivate the depth and precision of that language and sensitivity — is writing. (Wittgenstein)

내가 철학을 공부해야겠고 철학을 좋아하는 사람이라는 걸 알게 됐다. 루키우스 안나이우스 세네카, 프리드리히 니체, 헤르만 헤세, 아르투어 쇼펜하우어, 비트겐슈타인의 글들을 읽었다. 철학은 자신의 존재 의미와 가치를 인식하고 실현하는 삶을 살게 한다. 철학은 어떤 생각을 어떻게 할 지 알려준다. 내가 주체가 된 삶을 살게 한다. 결국 내가 묻는 행위가 철학이다. 내가 철학을 읽는 것이 좋았던 이유다. 

나는 스스로 사고하고 판단을 내릴 수 있는 지혜를 가지고 싶다는 목적지를 추가했다. 공학자로서 주어진 문제를 해결하고 논문을 쓰는 것만 인생의 목표로 삼기에는 부족하다고 생각한다. 나의 직업은 공학자이더라도 지식인이 아니라 "지성인"이 되고 싶다.
